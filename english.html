        <h1>Food Paradise In Taiwan </h1>
        <p data-aos="flip-down" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-delay="1000">
          Are you a food enthusiast? If you are, this night market will be your paradise. When I visited Taiwan, I went to Xi Men Ding night market together with my friends and teachers. It felt like visiting a food paradise, everywhere we went, we found various delicious foods. Not only was it filled with food, there were many other famous shops, like Popmart, Nike, Adidas, and so much more. </p>
        <h2>Foods in Xi Men Ding</h2>
        <p>First, I want to talk about the food there. Although there were many delicious food, one restaurant stood out, it was named豚骨拉麵凪. There were not a lot of options to eat, but all of them were mouth-watering. The soup’s flavor is so rich and they even provided us with a ton of seasoning to bring the food to the next level. Another iconic street food is stinky tofu. It changes many people’s perspective since most of us think stinky foods usually taste bad, but actually stinky tofu is really delicious despite its stinky smell. It almost tastes like an Indonesian dish named Tahu Gejrot. The tofu is topped with a little bit of the soup and a lot of cabbage. To top it off, the price of the 2 dishes was incredibly cheap.
        </p>
        <h2>The environment</h2>
        <p>Lastly, I want to talk about the environment. The night market is really clean compared to other night markets, and it is really crowded especially at night and holidays. Its filled with the aroma of traditional street food of Taiwan, neon signs above the streets and also street performers.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>   In conclusion, this night market is a must to go. It can make your tastebuds and wallet really happy. The food tastes like Michelin star foods. Other than the food, it can be a great spot to take photos with the neon sign, unique buildings, and the beautiful sky.</p>
